## 33rd Symposium on Naval Hydrodynamics, October 2020

Slides for my talk: "Turbulent wake prediction using deep convolutional neural networks", presented at the 33rd SNH (originally to be held in Osaka, Japan, and now adapted to an online format).

The presentation has been created with Inkscape using the JessyInk extension which organises slides by layers (.svg format). Open the `snh.svg` with any web browser to play the presentation. This presentation uses the CMU Serif font, so if it is not installed in your local computer you can correctly display the presentation with the `snh.pdf` file.

Additionally, the `snh.mp4` video contains the presentation of the slides.
